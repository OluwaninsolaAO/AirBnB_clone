# AirBnB_clone

This project is aimed towards creating a exact clone of the
AirBnB website, with some of its features. The project is set to
evolve in stages with the first step being: `Write a command 
interpreter to manage your AirBnB objects`.

## Step 1: Write a command interpreter to manage your AirBnB objects
Using ```cmd.Cmd``` This first step covers the following features 
for the command interpreter features:

+ Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
+ Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc…
+ Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
+ Update attributes of an object
+ Destroy an object
