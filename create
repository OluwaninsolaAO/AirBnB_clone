# A simple script to create an executable python file with
# a single positional arguement of the file name.
# The file name can be prefixed with a path too.

# For example, to create a python file named
# `base_model.py` in `models` directory:
# $ ./create models/base_model.py

# Another example, would be to create a pyhton file
# named `main.py` in the current directory:
# $ ./create main.py
#
# The script also launch vim editor to edit the file afterwards.
